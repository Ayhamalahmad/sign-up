# Calculator App

A simple calculator web application that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the calculator app [here](https://ayhamalahmad.github.io/task-8-calculator/).

## Warning

**Important:** Executing JavaScript from a string is an enormous security risk. It is far too easy for a bad actor to run arbitrary code when you use `eval()`. Please make sure to avoid using `eval()` in your production applications. For safer alternatives to executing dynamic code, refer to the [Never use eval()!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!) section in the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation.

## Features

- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Ability to clear the current input or reset the calculator.
